SMTP Email Sender
This Python script demonstrates how to send emails programmatically using SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol). It provides a convenient way to send emails directly from your Python code, allowing you to automate email notifications, alerts, or other communication tasks.

Features
Sends emails using SMTP server configuration.
Utilizes environment variables for sensitive data protection.
Customizable email body and subject.
Supports sending HTML emails if required.
Prerequisites
Before running the script, ensure you have Python installed on your system. You'll also need access to an SMTP server (such as Gmail) and valid email credentials.

Usage
Set up environment variables:

bash
Copy code
export EMAIL_SENDER="your_email@gmail.com"
export EMAIL_TO="recipient_email@example.com"
export SMTP_USER="your_email@gmail.com"
export SMTP_PASSWORD="your_smtp_password"
Run the script:

bash
Copy code
python smtp_email_sender.py
Configuration
EMAIL_SENDER: The sender's email address.
EMAIL_TO: The recipient's email address.
SMTP_USER: The SMTP username (usually the same as the sender's email address).
SMTP_PASSWORD: The SMTP password associated with the sender's email account.
Customization
Modify the email_subject and email_body variables to customize the email content.
Extend functionality to support attachments or HTML content if required.
Implement error handling or logging as per your application's needs.
Security Considerations
Keep your SMTP credentials secure and avoid sharing them in public repositories.
Use environment variables or secure storage mechanisms to protect sensitive information.
